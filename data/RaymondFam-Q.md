## Two-step Transfer of Ownership
In `Base.sol`, the contract inherits from `OwnableUpgradeable` where `_transferOwnership()` is invoked in `initialize()` allowing the oldOwner to transfer ownership to the newOwner. This function does not implement zero address check (like `transferOwnership` does) and proceeds directly to write the new owner's address into the owner's state variable, `_owner`. If the nominated EOA account is not a valid account, it is entirely possible the contract deployer may accidentally transfer ownership to an uncontrolled account or a zero address, breaking all functions with the onlyOwner() modifier.

Consider implementing a two step process where the deployer nominates an account and the nominated account needs to call an acceptOwnership() function for the transfer of ownership to fully succeed.  This will ensure the new owner is going to be fully aware of the ownership assigned/transferred other than having the above mistake avoided.
